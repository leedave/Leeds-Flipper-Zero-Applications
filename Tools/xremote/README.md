# Flipper Zero Cross Remote

## Current State
- Infrared working
- Pause working
- SubGhz in Development
- Edit/Rename/Delete features in development

## What this is?
This app combines commands used in IR and SubGhz into playlists that can be run with one click
<br><br>

### What good is this?
Imagine you want to sit down and watch a movie after a long days work. <br>
Your probably do something like the following<br>
- Turn on your TV with the IR TV remote<br>
- Turn on your Bluray player with the Blueray IR remote<br>
- Turn on your surround sound with the speaker IR remote<br>
- Turn on your ceiling fan using a subGhz remote<br>
- Turn on your AC using another remote<br>
- etc<br>
<br>
Wouldn't it be nicer to simply click one button and let everything happen? This is what this app wants to do. <br>

### Features
- Select commands from saved subGhz transmissions
- Select commands registered with the IR App (choose from the created remote buttons)<br>
- Chain these commands using an easy UI<br>
- Save chained commands to a file<br>
- Add pauses, becaue target systems are not always fast enough for multiple commands<br>
- Run file containing chained IR & SubGhz commands<br>
